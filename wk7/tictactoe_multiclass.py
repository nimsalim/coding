Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Multi-Class Object-Oriented Version

This file demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming through a multi-class
design. Unlike the single-class OOP version, this implementation separates concerns
into multiple cooperating classes, each with a single, well-defined responsibility.

Key Advanced OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
- Multi-Class Design: Breaking a problem into multiple classes
- Separation of Concerns: Each class has one clear responsibility
- Composition: Objects contain and coordinate other objects (HAS-A relationships)
- Delegation: Objects delegate work to other objects
- Encapsulation: Internal details are hidden behind public interfaces
- Scalability: Code adapts to different board sizes without modification
- Extensibility: Easy to add new features by extending classes

Architecture Overview:
    Game (Orchestrator)
    ├── Board (Grid Manager)
    └── Player (Data Holder) x2

Class Responsibilities:
- Board: Manages the game grid, validates moves, detects wins
- Player: Represents a player with their mark and optional name
- Game: Coordinates gameplay, manages turns, handles user interaction

Key Design Differences from Single-Class Version:
1. Separation: Logic is distributed across specialized classes
2. Composition: Game contains Board and Player objects
3. Scalability: Board size is configurable via a single constant
4. Coordinates: Uses row-column coordinates (e.g., "00", "11", "22")
5. Flexibility: Easy to extend with new features or game variations

Configurable Board Size:
Change BOARD_SIZE below to play with different board dimensions.
All game logic automatically adapts to the specified size.

class Player:
    """
    Represents a player in the tic-tac-toe game.

    This class demonstrates:
    - Simple data classes in OOP
    - Encapsulation of player-specific information
    - Modeling real-world entities as objects
    - Getter methods for accessing data

    The Player class is intentionally simple - it just holds data about
    a player. This shows that not all classes need complex logic; some
    classes exist primarily to organize and encapsulate data.

    In a multi-class design, this separation allows the Game class to
    work with Player objects without knowing the internal details of
    how player data is stored.

    Attributes:
        mark (str): The player's mark ('X' or 'O')
        name (str): Optional player name (defaults to mark if not provided)

    Example:
        >>> player = Player('X', 'Alice')
        >>> player.get_mark()
        'X'
        >>> player.get_name()

        - Instance variable initialization

        Args:
            mark (str): The player's mark ('X' or 'O')
            name (str): Optional player name. If not provided, uses mark as name.

        Example:
            >>> player1 = Player('X')  # Name defaults to 'X'

        demonstrates encapsulation.

        Returns:

class Board:
    """
    Manages the tic-tac-toe game board.

    This class demonstrates:
    - Encapsulation: Grid is private, accessed through methods
    - Single Responsibility: Only handles board operations
    - Scalability: Works with any board size
    - Dynamic initialization: Grid size determined at runtime

    The Board class is responsible for everything related to the game grid:
    - Storing the current state
    - Displaying the board
    - Validating moves
    - Placing marks
    - Detecting wins and ties

    The Board doesn't know about Players or Game rules - it just manages
    the grid. This separation allows the Board to be reused in different
    contexts or extended with new features without affecting other classes.

    Attributes:

        The board is initialized with each cell containing its coordinate
