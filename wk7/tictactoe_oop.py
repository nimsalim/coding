"""
Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Object-Oriented Programming Version

This file demonstrates how to create a tic-tac-toe game using Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles. This version is designed for students who have
learned about functions and classes and are ready to see how OOP can organize
code more effectively.

Key OOP concepts demonstrated:
- Classes: Blueprints for creating objects that bundle data and behavior
- Objects: Instances of classes that have their own state
- Methods: Functions that belong to a class and operate on its data
- Instance Variables: Data that belongs to a specific object (using self)
- Encapsulation: Keeping related data and behavior together in a class
- Constructor (__init__): Special method that initializes new objects
- Private Methods: Methods prefixed with _ for internal use only
- Public Methods: Methods without _ prefix for external use

Comparison with procedural versions:
- Procedural (tictactoe_lists.py, tictactoe_dict.py):
  * Uses global variables to store game state
  * Functions operate on data passed as parameters
  * State is scattered across multiple variables
  * Good for learning basic programming concepts

- Object-Oriented (this file):
  * Uses instance variables to store game state
  * Methods operate on the object's own data (self)
  * State is encapsulated within the class
  * Better for larger programs and code organization
  * Easier to create multiple games or extend functionality

Why use OOP?
- Organization: Related data and behavior are grouped together
- Reusability: Can create multiple game instances easily
- Maintainability: Changes to game logic are localized to methods
- Extensibility: Easy to add new features (undo, save/load, AI player)
- Real-world modeling: Objects represent real-world entities naturally

This version uses nested lists to represent the board, making it easy to
work with rows and columns using 2D indexing.

Usage example:
    # Create a new game
    game = TicTacToeGame()

    # Play the game interactively
    game.play()

    # Or use individual methods for custom game flow
    game.display_board()
    game.make_move(5)  # X moves to center
    game.make_move(1)  # O moves to top-left
    if game.is_game_over():
        print(f"Winner: {game.winner}")

# CLASS DEFINITION
# ============================================


class TicTacToeGame:
    """
    Represents a complete tic-tac-toe game with all game logic and state.

    This class encapsulates everything needed to play tic-tac-toe:
    - The game board (3x3 grid)
    - Which player's turn it is
    - Whether the game has ended
    - Who won (if anyone)
    - How many moves have been made

    By using a class, we keep all game-related data and behavior organized
    in one place. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and modify.

    Attributes:
        board (list): A 3x3 nested list representing the game board.
                     Each position starts with its number ('1'-'9') and
                     gets replaced with 'X' or 'O' when players move.
        board_size (int): The size of the board (3 for standard tic-tac-toe).
                         This makes it easier to extend to larger boards later.
        current_player (str): Either 'X' or 'O', indicating whose turn it is.
        game_over (bool): True if the game has ended, False if still playing.
        winner (str or None): 'X', 'O', 'Tie', or None if game is ongoing.
        moves_made (int): Counter tracking how many valid moves have been made.

    Example:
        >>> game = TicTacToeGame()
        >>> game.current_player
        'X'
        >>> game.game_over
        False

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize a new tic-tac-toe game.

        This is the constructor method (also called an initializer).
        It runs automatically when you create a new TicTacToeGame object.
        The __init__ method sets up the initial state of the game.

        The 'self' parameter is special in Python:
        - It refers to the specific object being created
        - It lets us attach data to this particular game instance
        - Every method in a class needs self as its first parameter

        Think of 'self' as "this specific game" - it's how we keep track
        of data that belongs to this particular game object.
